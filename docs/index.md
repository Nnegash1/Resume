# PROJECT
### GRIT-VIEW
An anonymous, online professor-rating website, which allows studenst in University of Maryland Baltimore County to share classroom experiences to help fellow students make critical education choices. 

- Designed a database system to handle the data of the instructors and all the courses thought in UMBC using PostgreSQL
- Implemented and designed the back-end for user login credentials using Flask, python, and PostgreSQL.
- Development processes: Agile scrum
- Implementation and design: [Gritview](https://github.com/Nnegash1/GritView)

### VR Robotic Arm
This project presents a simulation methodology applied to a robotic arm. Its goal is to allow the arm perform easy movement in a 2d environment. The robotic arm is designed in Vrealm, a 3d rendering application, and the movement of the arm is implemented by using Matlab. The work includes mathematical modeling of the arms movement by using inverse kinematics.

- Full implementation : [Robotic Arm](https://github.com/Nnegash1/BMI)

### Computer Architecture 
Designed and implemented a simple CPU that preforms 8 bit addition, subtraction, and bit-wise operations using MATLAB.

- Full design and implementation: [CPU](https://github.com/Nnegash1/CPU_Implementation)

### PREDICTION MODEL
Implemented and train regression models that predicts the closing price of **Apple Stock Index AAPL** with **99% accuracy**. 

- Implementation and design: [Prediction model](https://github.com/Nnegash1/stock_prediction_model)

### Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks
Perform image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks in Tensorflow and keras on [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset. The final model has a complex architectire with stacked convolutional models, maxpooling, droupout and dense layers. Furthermore, the model uses learning rate scheduling and early stopping. The final model perfromed 88% accuracy.

- Implementation: [Image Classifier](https://github.com/Nnegash1/Image-Classification-with-CNN/blob/main/Image_classification_CNN.ipynb)
